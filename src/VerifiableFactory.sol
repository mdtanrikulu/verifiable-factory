     * - The proxy is fully managed by the factory, which controls upgrades and other administrative methods.
     * - The event `ProxyDeployed` is emitted, logging details of the deployment including the sender, proxy address, salt, and implementation.

     * @param salt A value provided by the caller to ensure uniqueness of the proxy address.
